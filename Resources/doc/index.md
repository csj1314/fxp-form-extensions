## Installation

### Download the bundle using composer

Add Sonatra FormExtensions in your composer.json:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "sonatra/form-extensions": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

Or tell composer to download the bundle by running the command:

```bash
$ php composer.phar require sonatra/form-extensions:"~1.0"
```

Composer will install the bundle to your project's `vendor/sonatra` directory.
